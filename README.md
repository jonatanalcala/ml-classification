# Foundations of Classification Algorithms

This project implements and evaluates simple machine learning classification algorithms using the **UCI Adult Income dataset** to predict whether an individual earns more than $50K/year.  

## Features
- Preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features  
- Implementation of **Perceptron** and **Adaline** (including AdalineSGD)  
- scikit-learn models: **Logistic Regression** and **SVM**  
- Visualization of decision boundaries  
- Reflection on algorithm performance, scaling, regularization, and gradient descent methods  

## Deliverables
- Clean, well-documented Python code  
- Validation output CSV files for each algorithm  
- Presentation slides and recorded discussion  

## Data
- `project_adult.csv`  
- `project_validation_inputs.csv`  
- Source: [UCI Adult Income Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult)
